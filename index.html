		<h2>Void Linux for PowerPC/Power ISA (unofficial)</h2>
		<p>Void Linux ppc is a staging fork of the <a href="https://voidlinux.org">Void Linux</a> distribution intended for the PowerPC/Power architecture. It supports 64-bit and 32-bit hardware, with 64-bit supporting both little and big endian modes, while aiming to be legacy-free, using the ELFv2 ABI for both. It supports both glibc and musl.</p>
		<p>We have an explicit goal of upstreaming as many changes as possible - the project therefore retains a fairly small number of patches, most changes are merged into Void itself or upstream software projects as soon as they're ready.</p>
		<p>Please see the <a href="https://docs.voidlinux-ppc.org">documentation</a> for up-to-date status information, installation instructions, FAQ and other resources.</p>

			<h3>Hardware support</h3>
			<p>Most distributions now support only 64-bit little endian hardware. Void-ppc aims to change this and work on a wide variety of hardware.</p>
			<p>The little endian builds require POWER8 or newer, but the big endian flavors start with 970/G5 (64-bit, AltiVec is required), while the 32-bit builds are completely generic.</p>

			<h3>C library support</h3>
			<p>Just like Void itself, both glibc and musl are supported, resulting in 6 different flavors of the system.</p>
			<p>As an oddity, Void-ppc uses the modern ELFv2 ABI on both little endian and big endian 64-bit builds. This is a requirement with the musl libc, but there is currently no other distribution using ELFv2 for glibc as well.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-md-4">
			<h3>Package support</h3>
			<p>Void-ppc has a goal of as complete repository coverage as possible for all targets, not leaving anything behind.</p>
			<p>While this is currently WiP (but 64-bit LE is nearing completeness), the ultimate goal is first class support. For instance, we are the only distro to ship a working Qt5 WebEngine (Chromium based) component.</p>
