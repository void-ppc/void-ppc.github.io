The basic old site was far from ideal, so here's a new one based on [the official website](https://github.com/void-linux/void-linux.github.io).

It's powered by Jekyll and runs on the GitHub Sites infra.

Nothing much else to say for now; new documentation is also being worked on, and will feature a FAQ and all sorts of other info, replacing the one in the GitHub repo.

And don't forget to join us on IRC, #voidlinux-ppc on freenode.
