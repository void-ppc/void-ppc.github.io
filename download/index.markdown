## Download installable base live images

***PLEASE NOTE: To install the desktop environment, DON'T choose "install from
network" choose the local install. VERY IMPORTANT!***

There are installable live images for all 6 flavors. You need to choose the kind
you want, and whether you want a desktop environment out of box or not.

All **live images** and **rootfs tarballs** are available at:

* [https://repo.voidlinux-ppc.org/live/current](https://repo.voidlinux-ppc.org/live/current)

The ppc64le images have these requirements:

- At least a POWER8 CPU or equivalent (POWER ISA 2.07, with little endian
  AltiVec/VSX support; notably e6500 is not supported)
- Currently OpenFirmware (SLOF) and OpenPOWER based systems are tested

The ppc64 images have these requirements:

- At least a PowerPC 970 CPU or equivalent (AltiVec required; so 970/G5, Cell,
  POWER6/7/8/9, e6500 will work, while e5500 and POWER4/POWER5 will not)
- Currently OpenFirmware (SLOF, Apple) and OpenPOWER based systems are tested

The ppc images have these requirements:

- A generic PowerPC CPU
- Currently OpenFirmware based Apple systems are tested

All require at least 350MB disk space for installation. 64-bit systems should
have at least 96MB RAM, 32-bit ones can do with less.

These may not be exhaustive, but the live images contain data necessary for
boot on OF and OpenPOWER systems and utilize GRUB. If you succeed in running
the live ISOs on other systems (or know how to make them work), please let us
know.

Log in as **anon/root**, password **voidlinux**.

To start the installer just execute the *void-installer* utility with enough
permissions (i.e *sudo*). The installer has paths for OpenPOWER, Apple and
CHRP systems.

Additional live images with *flavors* (an additional Desktop Environment with
autologin) are also available:

- Enlightenment
- Cinnamon
- LXDE
- LXQT
- MATE
- XFCE

These images need at least 256 or 512 MB of RAM in order to work correctly.

## Verifying file integrity

The
[sha256sums.txt](https://repo.voidlinux-ppc.org/live/current/sha256sums.txt)
file contains the `SHA256` hashes to verify the integrity of the downloaded files.

## Mirrors

There are several mirrors to help lighten the load on the primary infrastructure.

Tier 1 mirrors sync directly from the primary and contain everything. They are
also required to provide https. Other mirrors may sync from somewhere else and
are allowed to host specific things only.

To change your mirrors to use a different set, you must create files
in `/etc/xbps.d` with the same names as those in `/usr/share/xbps.d`.
Once you have created such files, replace the URL with one of the servers
below. Only the files containing 'repository' in the filename need to be
duplicated to `/etc/xbps.d/`.

The default is [https://auto.voidlinux-ppc.org](https://auto.voidlinux-ppc.org).
This is supposed to be load-balancing between available Tier 1 mirrors, but that
currently does not work, so it's equivalent to the primary for the time being.

### Tier 1 Mirrors

  * https://repo.voidlinux-ppc.org (EU: Czech Republic)
  * https://mirrors.servercentral.com/void-ppc/ (USA: Chicago)
  * https://ppc.exqa.de

### Tier 2 Mirrors

The are currently no Tier 2 mirrors. If you want to provide a mirror of either
kind, please contact us.
